### A brave warrior for a great mission
Synapse, a brave little robot who went to the other side of the universe in search of new technologies, just came bake to the Earth...
In the course of his long trip, he made a revolutionary discovery : **Microservices**.

### The challenge
Have you already felt like implementing new features in your solution was like a pick-up-sticks game ?
Have you ever experienced a loss of hours, or days, trying to deploy just a "small improvement" ?
Now imagine a world where this is no longer an issue, a world where your system can scale easily without no actions.
Imagine a world where you can follow the market trend as quick as it evolves !

### Divide and rule
The principle is that simple... And yet we are still so far.
With such a discovery, our civilization has no more excuses !
