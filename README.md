Synapse, a brave little robot who went to the other side of the universe in search of new technologies, just came bake to the Earth...
In the course of his long trip, he made a revolutionary discovery : "Microservices".

Have you already felt like implementing new features in your solution was like a pick-up-sticks game ?
Have you ever experienced a loss of hours, or days, trying to deploy just a "small improvement" ?
Now imagine a world where this is no longer an issue, a world where your system can scale easily without no actions.
Imagine a world where you can follow the market trend as quick as it evolves !


Divide and rule, the principle is that simple... And yet we are still far from it.
With such a discovery, our civilization has no more excuses !

Future is near, future is now...
